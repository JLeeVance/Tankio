        'message':"The stocking in this tank is great! You could push the boundaries further with regards to planting, but as of now your water quality should be quite clean for your fish! We would still reccomend performing a 15% water change weekly. Be sure to test your levels prior to each water change to confirm your tank's health. "

Keep an eye on your levels, and be sure to perform a 20% water change weekly along with your standard testing. You might consider adding some plants!'

        'message':"The stocking in this tank should perform as an average household fishtank would. While your stocking is appropriate, you might consider adding some plants to balance out your water quality. Be sure to keep on top of your 25% water changes weekly to ensure the fish do not suffer."
